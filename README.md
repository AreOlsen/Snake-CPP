# Snake-CPP
Simple C++ snake, made as first ever attempt as C++.
This is my first ever C++ project, and the code may look weird as there are components that I am first now learning due to the languages I am proficient in taking care of that automatically.
Such as pointers and header files, also memory management and such.
QUITE NEAT THO.
